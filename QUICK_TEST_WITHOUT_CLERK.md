# ðŸš€ Quick Test Without Clerk (Backend Only)

While you're getting your Clerk keys, you can test the backend API directly!

---

## Test Backend API Without Frontend

### 1. Make Sure Backend is Running

```bash
./start-backend.sh
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Starting FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

---

## 2. Test Endpoints with cURL

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"healthy"}
```

### Root Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

Expected response:
```json
{"message":"Vibe Marketing Autopilot API","status":"active"}
```

---

## 3. Test Campaign Creation (with Mock Data)

**Important:** You need to add your API keys to `backend/.env` first:

```bash
# Edit backend/.env
INSTANTLY_API_KEY=inst_your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

Then test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/create-campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://myapp.com",
    "target_audience": "SaaS founders, 1-10 employees, US-based",
    "user_id": "test_user_123"
  }'
```

This will:
1. âœ… Call OpenAI to generate 3 email variants
2. âœ… Create a lead list in Instantly
3. âœ… Create and activate a campaign
4. âœ… Save to Supabase database

Expected response (takes 10-15 seconds):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "campaign_id": "campaign_xyz",
  "lead_list_id": "list_xyz",
  "variants": [
    {
      "subject": "Quick question about {{company}}",
      "body": "Hi {{firstName}},..."
    },
    {
      "subject": "Solving a problem for {{company}}",
      "body": "Hey {{firstName}},..."
    },
    {
      "subject": "{{company}} + MyApp?",
      "body": "{{firstName}},..."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 4. Test Other Endpoints

### Get Campaigns (after creating one)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/campaigns?user_id=test_user_123"
```

### Get Campaign Analytics
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/campaign_xyz?user_id=test_user_123"
```

---

## 5. Use Postman or Insomnia

If you prefer a GUI:

### Postman
1. Download from https://postman.com
2. Import this collection:

```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "Vibe Marketing API",
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "Health Check",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "header": [],
        "url": {
          "raw": "http://localhost:8000/health",
          "protocol": "http",
          "host": ["localhost"],
          "port": "8000",
          "path": ["health"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Create Campaign",
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "header": [
          {
            "key": "Content-Type",
            "value": "application/json"
          }
        ],
        "body": {
          "mode": "raw",
          "raw": "{\n  \"url\": \"https://myapp.com\",\n  \"target_audience\": \"SaaS founders\",\n  \"user_id\": \"test_user\"\n}"
        },
        "url": {
          "raw": "http://localhost:8000/api/create-campaign",
          "protocol": "http",
          "host": ["localhost"],
          "port": "8000",
          "path": ["api", "create-campaign"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 6. Test with Python

Create `test_api.py`:

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

# Test health
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/health")
print("Health:", response.json())

# Test campaign creation
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/create-campaign",
    json={
        "url": "https://myapp.com",
        "target_audience": "SaaS founders",
        "user_id": "test_user_123"
    }
)
print("Campaign:", response.json())
```

Run it:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

---

## 7. Check Instantly.ai Dashboard

After creating a campaign:

1. Log into your Instantly.ai account
2. Go to **Campaigns**
3. You should see: `Launch - https://myapp.com`
4. Click on it to see the AI-generated email variants
5. Check if it's activated and sending

---

## What This Tests

âœ… Backend API is running
âœ… OpenAI integration works (AI copy generation)
âœ… Instantly.ai integration works (campaign creation)
âœ… Supabase integration works (data storage)
âœ… All endpoints respond correctly

---

## Frontend Will Work Once You:

1. Get Clerk API keys from https://clerk.com
2. Add them to `frontend/.env.local`
3. Restart frontend with `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000

---

## Quick Summary

**Backend Testing (No Clerk Needed):**
```bash
# 1. Start backend
./start-backend.sh

# 2. Test health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 3. Test campaign creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/create-campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://test.com","target_audience":"test","user_id":"test"}'
```

**Frontend (Needs Clerk Keys):**
1. Get keys from https://clerk.com
2. Add to `frontend/.env.local`
3. Run `npm run dev`

---

**The backend is fully functional and you can test all API endpoints right now!** ðŸŽ¯
