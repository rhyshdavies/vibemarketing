## Firestore Collections

Your Firebase project has these collections:

### `campaigns`
Stores all email campaigns with stats and variants

### `users`
User profiles and subscription plans

### `email_accounts`
Connected email accounts for sending

### `lead_lists`
Lead lists for campaigns

---

## How to Start the Application

### Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/rhyshamilton-davies/vibemarketing
./start-backend.sh
```

Backend will start on: http://localhost:8000

### Start Frontend
```bash
./start-frontend.sh
```

Frontend will start on: http://localhost:4000

---

## Test the Full Flow

1. **Visit** http://localhost:4000
2. **Click** "Get Started"
3. **Enter:**
   - URL: `https://yourapp.com`
   - Target: `SaaS founders, 1-10 employees`
4. **Click** "Generate Campaign"
5. **Wait** 10-15 seconds for AI copy generation
6. **Review** the 3 email variants
7. **Click** "Launch Campaign"

The campaign will be:
- âœ… Saved to Firebase/Firestore
- âœ… Created in your Instantly.ai account
- âœ… Activated and ready to send

---

## View Your Data

### Firebase Console
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/vibe-marketing-autopilot/firestore

You can see all:
- Campaigns created
- User data
- Lead lists
- Email accounts

### Instantly.ai Dashboard
https://app.instantly.ai/campaigns

You can see:
- Active campaigns
- Email sequences
- Analytics and stats

---

## API Keys Configured

âœ… **Instantly.ai API Key**: Configured
âœ… **OpenAI API Key**: Configured
âœ… **Firebase Credentials**: Configured

All services are ready to use!

---

## Firebase vs Supabase

**Why we switched:**
- âœ… You have free Firebase credits
- âœ… No SQL schema setup needed
- âœ… Simpler for MVP/demo phase
- âœ… Real-time updates built-in
- âœ… Better for NoSQL document structure
- âœ… Easier deployment

**What's different:**
- NoSQL (documents) instead of SQL (tables)
- Automatic scaling
- No migrations needed
- Better offline support

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the full flow** by creating a campaign
2. **Check Firebase Console** to see your data
3. **Check Instantly.ai** to see the campaign created
4. **Add real leads** via CSV upload or manual entry
5. **Monitor analytics** in the dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Firebase connection error
Check that `backend/firebase-credentials.json` exists and `.env` has the correct path.

### Frontend shows errors
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Production Deployment Notes

When deploying to production (Railway/Render/Vercel):

1. **Upload** `firebase-credentials.json` as a secure file OR
2. **Set** `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` as environment variable with the full JSON content

Make sure to:
- Add proper Firestore security rules
- Enable authentication (re-enable Clerk)
- Set up proper CORS origins
- Use production API keys
